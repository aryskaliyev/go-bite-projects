### Error Propagation: Philosophy of Error Propagation
- What errors are? When do they occur, and what benefit do they provide?
	- Errors indicate that your system has entered a state in which it cannot fulfill an operation that a user either explicitly or implicitly requested. Because of this, it needs to relay a few pieces of critical information:
		- **What happened**
			- This is the part of the error that contains information about what happened, e.g., "disk full", "socket closed", or "credentials expired".
		- **When and where it occurred**
			- Errors should always contain a complete stack trace starting with how the call was initiated and ending with where the error was instantiated. The stack trace should *not* be contained in the error message, but should be easily accessible when handling the error up the stack.
			- The error should contain information regarding the context it's running within.
			- The error should contain the time on the machine the error was instantiated on, in UTC.
		- **A friendly user-facing message**
			- The message that gets displayed to the user should be customized to suit your system and its users. It should only contain abbreviated and relevant information from the previous two points. A friendly message is human-centric, gives some indication of whether the issue is transitory, and should be about one line of text.
		- **How the user can get more information**
			- At some point, someone will likely want to know, in detail, what happened when the error occurred. Errors that are presented to users should provide an ID that can be cross-referenced to a corresponding log that displays the full information of the error: time the error occurred (not the time the error was logged), the stack strace -- everything you stuffed into the error when it was created. It can also be helpful to include a hash of the stack trace to aid in aggregating like issues in bug trackers. 

- All errors can be placed in one of two categories:
	- Bugs
	- Known edge cases (e.g., broken network connections, failed disk writes, etc.)

- Bugs are errors that you have not customized to your system, or "raw" errors -- your known edge cases. Raw errors are always bugs.
