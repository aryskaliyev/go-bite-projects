### Error Propagation: Philosophy of Error Propagation
- What errors are? When do they occur, and what benefit do they provide?
	- Errors indicate that your system has entered a state in which it cannot fulfill an operation that a user either explicitly or implicitly requested. Because of this, it needs to relay a few pieces of critical information:
		- **What happened**
			- This is the part of the error that contains information about what happened, e.g., "disk full", "socket closed", or "credentials expired".
		- **When and where it occurred**
			- Errors should always contain a complete stack trace starting with how the call was initiated and ending with where the error was instantiated. The stack trace should *not* be contained in the error message, but should be easily accessible when handling the error up the stack.
			- The error should contain information regarding the context it's running within.
			- The error should contain the time on the machine the error was instantiated on, in UTC.
		- **A friendly user-facing message**
			- The message
